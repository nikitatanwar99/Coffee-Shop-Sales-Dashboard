# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard

A dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides a clear view of coffee shop sales performance—focused on revenue trends, top selling products, store comparisons, and daily order behavior.


**Description**

The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard is built to analyse daily café transactions across multiple locations.

It helps business teams, café owners and data analysts understand which coffee items sell the most, which store performs the best, peak buying time patterns, and what drives higher revenue.


**Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Data Visualization & Dashboard Design

📂 Power Query – Data Cleaning & ETL Transformation

🧠 DAX Measures – KPI calculations (Total Sales, Avg. Bill, Total Orders etc.)

📝 Data Modelling –  date dimensions

📁 File Format – .pbix for development + .png for dashboard preview


**Data Source**

Source: Coffee Shop sales dataset (CSV/Excel)
